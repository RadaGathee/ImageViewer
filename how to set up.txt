Just  to be clear, you should be careful with running any vbs script and bat script.

Reasons why I'm giving you three files.

When you set picture002.ps1 - (The powershell script)as the file ran at a particular time, 
it will only show the file as a text file, won't show the image form - Not what you want.

So to rectify this, you make a .bat file to run it via cmd, problem with this,
it will indeed show the form, but the issue is, it will bring up the command prompt. you don't want the user to see it.

So to rectify this, you need to make a .vbs script, the problem is a vbs will be flagged down by your anti-virus, remeber I said it's risky to run them


NOTE:
Ensure to test each time, via the task scheduler, don't hard code the run time...
Save you Image in the folder you want
